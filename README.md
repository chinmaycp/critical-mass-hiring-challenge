# Critical Mass 2022 Hiring/Coding Challenge
My submission for the Critical Mass hiring/coding challenge.

### Work / Project Examples

- Personal Website (chinmaypatel.ca)
  - https://github.com/chinmaycp/chinmaypatel.ca
  - Built with HTML, CSS, & JS.
- Search Me, a Google Search clone powered by Wikipedia API
  - https://github.com/chinmaycp/search-me
  - Built with HTML, JS, and SASS.
- Kothar, a food inventory management app (remodeling/refactoring)
  - https://github.com/patelro/kothar
  - Disussed with client regarding project details/features/timelines, gathered team of volunteer developers and peer-programmed with them to build up the project.
  - Specifically worked on firebase communication (firebase API), fetching data from firestore database, and rendering it for different use cases (such as a full inventory table view, or showcasing most used items).
  - Oversaw implementation to always align with vision of client.

### Inspiration

- 30 Seconds of Code
  - https://www.30secondsofcode.org/
  - It's an open source library of high quality code snippets and articles that can be used by developers in their projects. As someone figuring out the open source scene, I am inspired by the accessibility of (sometimes) complex concepts, components, algorithms provided.
- Qiskit, an open-source SDK for quantum computing/development
  - https://qiskit.org/
  - It allows beginners and expert alike to learn and dabble with quantum computing. I have recently started taking its introductory course, which highlights the basics of quantum computing and allows you to simulate circuits with Python/Jupyter notebooks.

### Focus

If given the opportunity to build/learn anything, during the internship, I would love to do three things:
- Build out a full-stack web application along with a corresponding mobile application, using a framework such as React Native
- Learn proficient testing methods for web/mobile applications
- Learn brand, design, and data strategies, to provide a seamless user/customer experience
